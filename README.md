# RinT

RinT is an ongoing development tool designed and developed by Raphael Barreiro, an IT student
looking for his first job as a developer.

You can try out all the input fields! For now, I still haven't integrated a 
database to create a profile/login and save the changes made by a user.
I'm still studying about back-end and, as soon as posible, I will do that.

Thank you for testing it! Feel free to contact me and give any feedbacks.
